# Privacy Redirector
This userscript redirects popular social media platforms to their privacy respecting frontends.

You can add the script from [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/436359-privacy-redirector), or you can clone this repo and add it [manually](https://violentmonkey.github.io/guide/creating-a-userscript/).

## To-do
- [x] Redirect old.reddit to teddit.net
- [x] Add [TikTok](https://github.com/pablouser1/ProxiTok), [Imgur](https://codeberg.org/video-prize-ranch/rimgo#instances), [Medium](https://sr.ht/~edwardloveall/scribe/) redirections
- [ ] Use something more sustainable instead of "case"s for redirections
- [ ] Find a way to redirect to the up instances without releasing a whole new verison.
