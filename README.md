# Privacy Redirector
This userscript redirects popular social media platforms to their privacy respecting frontends.

You can add the script from [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/436359-privacy-redirector), or you can clone this repo and add it [manually](https://violentmonkey.github.io/guide/creating-a-userscript/).

## To-do
- [x] Redirect old.reddit to teddit.net
- [x] Add [TikTok](https://github.com/pablouser1/ProxiTok), [Imgur](https://codeberg.org/video-prize-ranch/rimgo#instances), [Medium](https://sr.ht/~edwardloveall/scribe/) redirections
- [ ] Use something more sustainable instead of "case"s for redirections
- [ ] Find a way to redirect to the up instances without releasing a whole new verison.
- [ ] Redirect Medium user pages to Medium itself without giving an error

## FAQ
__Why scribe.rip doesn't redirect to user pages?__
> "It's intentional that there is no way to browse content from a user, see popular posts, consume via an RSS feed, or further engage with an article via comments or "claps". I want to spend my time encouraging writers to move to worthy platforms, not making a bad platform worthy."
