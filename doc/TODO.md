## To-do
- [ ] Use `pathname.startsWith` instead of `href.indexOf`
- [ ] Use [farside.link](https://github.com/benbusby/farside) for [Wikiless](https://github.com/dybdeskarphet/privacy-redirector/blob/967a316e46b5010cdf93de6048b5927c1da621f2/privacy-redirector.js#L251)too. 
- [ ] Fix: Medium stops redirecting to scribe.rip after entering a user page

### Not possible (?)
- [ ] Make the previous site after redirecting is the original previous site and not the platform itself.
