> I know that some of the Invidious instances are faulty, I'm going to fix it in a month along with all the to-dos below.

## To-do
- [ ] Add Piped as an alternative to Invidious
- [ ] Fix: Medium stops redirecting to scribe.rip after entering a user page
- [ ] Add Reel and Story redirection for Bibliogram
- [ ] Add more Bibliogram instance
- [ ] Rewrite some parts (minimalize)
- [ ] Reassign variable types properly
- [ ] Make a list from all the possible URL types (ex. `ig.com/reel/`, `ig.com/p/`, `rdt.com/r/`, `rdt.com/u`)
- [ ] Change multiple replace commands into [one](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16577007).
- [ ] Don't use variables for regex

### Not possible (?)
- [ ] ~~Make the previous site after redirecting is the original previous site and not the platform itself.~~
- [ ] ~~Find a way to redirect to the up instances without releasing a whole new verison.~~
